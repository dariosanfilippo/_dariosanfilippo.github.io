#### algorithmic music – complex adaptive systems – performance ecosystems – audio programming – DSP

___

I am a music feedback systems specialist, performer, composer, audio programmer, and researcher.

I have a PhD in computer music from the University of Edinburgh and I have published for peer-reviewed journals and conferences such as Computer Music Journal, Music/Technology Journal, International Computer Music Conference, and Sound and Music Computing Conference. I have also performed in international contemporary music festivals and venues all over Europe.

My research focuses on the exploration of new music through artificial intelligence and artificial life implemented via complex adaptive systems. Complex behaviours are achieved by combining fundamental principles in the design of audio feedback networks such as _agency_, _autopoiesis_, _evolvability_, _fitness_, and _radical constructivism_.
