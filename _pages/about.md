[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

algorithmic music – complex adaptive systems – performance ecosystems – audio programming – DSP
___
I am a music feedback systems specialist, performer, composer, audio programmer, and researcher.

I have a PhD in computer music from the University of Edinburgh and I have published for peer-reviewed journals and conferences such as Computer Music Journal, Music/Technology Journal, International Computer Music Conference, and Sound and Music Computing Conference. I have also performed in international contemporary music festivals and venues all over Europe.

My research focuses on the exploration of new music through artificial intelligence and artificial life implemented via complex adaptive systems. Complex behaviours are achieved by combining fundamental principles in the design of audio feedback networks such as _agency_, _autopoiesis_, _evolvability_, _fitness_, and _radical constructivism_.

These systems are then deployed in live performance through human-machine interaction or autonomous and semi-atuonomous machines with or without human intervention.
