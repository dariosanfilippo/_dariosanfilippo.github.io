[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a music feedback systems specialist, performer, composer, audio programmer, and researcher.

I have a PhD in computer music from the University of Edinburgh and I have published for peer-reviewed journals and conferences such as Computer Music Journal, Music/Technology Journal, International Computer Music Conference, and Sound and Music Computing Conference. I have also performed in international contemporary music festivals and venues all over Europe.

My work is on artificial intelligence and artificial life through complex adaptive systems and nonconventional DSP techniques for the exploration of new music in human-Â­machine interaction performance and autonomous machines.
