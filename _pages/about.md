#### algorithmic music – complex adaptive systems – AI and ALife –  performance ecosystems – audio programming – DSP

___

I am a music feedback systems specialist, performer, composer, audio programmer, teacher, and researcher.

I have a PhD in computer music from the University of Edinburgh and my research focuses on the exploration of new music through artificial intelligence and artificial life implemented via complex adaptive systems. 

My work combines principles of agency, autopoiesis, evolvability, fitness, and radical constructivism for the design of complex audio feedback networks that are deployed in live performance for human-machine interaction or autonomous machines.
