This is a piece for three or more instrumental performers based on relational mechanisms taking place in the domain of sound and distributed among the musicians. *Functions* and *descriptors* are the two main aspects of the score. Two behaviours, diverging and converging, describe the functions, which, respectively, correspond to the characteristics of positive and negative feedback mechanisms concerning a state of equilibrium in a system. The descriptors are musically-relevant information extracted from the context by the performers and used to deploy the functions.
