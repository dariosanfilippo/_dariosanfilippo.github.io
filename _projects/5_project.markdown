Inexorable Shifting 2 is the adaptive version of a work developed in 2013. The piece consists of an autonomous self-oscillating feedback delay network of frequency shifting units. Whereas the original work had fixed shift values for each of the node in the network, this version performs a time-domain spectral centroid analysis to determine the direction of the frequency shift and implement counterbalancing mechanisms. A studio recording of the piece can be listened to [here](https://soundcloud.com/dario-sanfilippo/inexorable-shifting-2).
