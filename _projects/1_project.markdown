The work implements a complex adaptive system in an eco-systemic configuration. Particularly, the system was designed to operate towards the upper audible frequency threshold to maximise the directionality of acoustic waves. Hence, the audience requires to stand in front of the loudspeakers to perceive sounds, inevitably perturbing the system's microphone-loudspeaker connection and self-modulation, emphasising the second-order cybernetic nature of the work.

The work was funded by the City of Vienna.
