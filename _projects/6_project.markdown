Phase Transitions is a long-form piece for an autonomous adaptive ecosystem operating in real-time which explores the idea of digital deterioration and the behavioural changes in dynamical systems with varying parameters. The work is based on feedback delay networks with nonlinear transfer functions, specifically, saturating units (also known as soft-clipping functions) whose purpose is to ensure stability in self-oscillating conditions but also to make the deterioration process possible. The adaptive infrastructure detects phase transitions to microscopically explore the dynamics of such variations. A studio recording (non-ecosystemic) of the piece can be listened to [here](https://soundcloud.com/dario-sanfilippo/phase-transitions).

The work was commissioned and funded by the [Rotting Sounds](https://rottingsounds.org/threads/auditorium/phase-transitions/) project.
