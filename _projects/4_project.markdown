This performance is inspired by von Foerster's principle of Order from Noise. This work is my first investigation of principles of evolvability and meta-adaptation for music systems and it implements a network of adaptive mechanisms with morphing positive-to-negative-to-positive feedback relationships. The performance consists of initialising the system with one millisecond of background noise and subsequently leave it to evolve unattended for about three-to-ten minutes. The process is repeated a number of times, decided by the performer, to show the divergence from an origin and the high sensitivity to initial conditions.
