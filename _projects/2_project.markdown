Constructing Realities is a performance project for autonomous DSP network. This work follows principles of radical constructivism and evolvability to implement a system that is responsible for the design of its adaptation and perception infrastructure. A studio recording of the piece can be listened to [here](https://soundcloud.com/dario-sanfilippo/constructing-realities-2019-2020).
