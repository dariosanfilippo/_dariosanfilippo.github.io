Single-Fader Versatility is a human-machine interaction performance implementing the idea of cybernetic mapping and reduced intervention. The machine is a feedback network containing eight semi-autonomous agents that include audio processing techniques such as state-variable filtering, recursive nonlinear distortion, audio-driven granulation, sampling, pulse-width modulation, and frequency shifting modulation. An excerpt of a live performance from 2016 can be listened to [here](https://soundcloud.com/dario-sanfilippo/live-at-sculpture-court-edinburgh-college-of-art-28th-march-2016-extract).
